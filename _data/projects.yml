    ![tran](./images/linear_grid.gif){: width="180" height="180" style="float:left; padding:16px"} We apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to the domain of digital pathology. Current machine learning research for digital pathology focuses on diagnosis, 
    but we suggest a different approach and advocate that generative models could help to understand and find fundamental morphological characteristics of cancer tissue. 
    In this paper, we develop a framework which allows GANs to capture key tissue features, and present a vision of how these could link cancer tissue and DNA in the future. 
    To this end, we trained our model on breast cancer tissue from a medium size cohort of 526 patients, producing high fidelity images. We further study how a range of relevant 
    GAN evaluation metrics perform on this task, and propose to evaluate synthetic images with clinically/pathologically meaningful features. Our results show that these models are 
    able to capture key morphological characteristics that link with phenotype, such as survival time and Estrogen-receptor (ER) status. Using an Inception-V1 network as feature extraction, 
    our models achieve a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 18.4. We find that using pathology meaningful features on these metrics show consistent performance, with a FID of 8.21. 
    Furthermore, we asked two expert50athologists to distinguish our generated images from real ones, finding no significant difference between them.

    ![tran](./images/DNNLibGen.png){: width="35%" height="35%" style="float:left; padding:16px"} We propose a new modeling methodology using deep learning techniques for generating timing 
    models for Static Timing Analysis (STA). Current device behavior is non-linear, non-monotonic and exhibits high sensitivity to (Process Voltage Temperature) PVT variation which imposes a 
    myriad of design challenges including the need for analysis at several PVT corners. While complete PVT coverage is crucial for detecting design issues early and achieving time-to-market goals 
    with improved predictability, the number of PVT corners are growing exponentially and library generation has also become a significant bottleneck in current design cycles. To this end, we have 
    developed a novel methodology for timing library generation that uses data from sparse characterization in PVT space and generates delay models at required sign-off corners. 
    We have employed deep neural nets with residual connections for delay modeling and our methodology enables a 'single model' to fully comprehend multiple cell types, PVT corners 
    and generate required PVT timing libraries. The proposed library-generator uses a novel inter-corner model to generate delay tables at 17 test corners using 7 corners as reference. 
    In addition, we have developed an intra-corner model, to generate dense 8x8 delay tables using delays from 10 slew/load points as reference. The results show that, using these models, 
    we are able to achieve key improvements with over 98.7% of calculated delays within acceptable tolerance while reducing characterization run-time for early milestones by up to 60%.
