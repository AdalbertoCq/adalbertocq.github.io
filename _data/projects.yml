    **Abstract:** Application of deep learning in digital pathology shows promise on improving disease diagnosis and understanding. We present a deep generative model that learns to simulate high-fidelity cancer tissue images while mapping the real images onto an interpretable low dimensional latent space. The key to the model is an encoder trained by a previously developed generative adversarial network, PathologyGAN. We study the latent space using 249K images from two breast cancer cohorts. We find that the latent space encodes morphological characteristics of tissues (e.g. patterns of cancer, lymphocytes, and stromal cells). In addition, the latent space reveals distinctly enriched clusters of tissue architectures in the high-risk patient group.

Current machine learning research for digital pathology focuses on diagnosis, but we suggest a different approach and advocate that generative models could drive forward the understanding of morphological characteristics of cancer tissue. In this paper, we develop a framework which allows GANs to capture key tissue features and uses these characteristics to give structure to its latent space. To this end, we trained our model on 249K H&E breast cancer tissue images. 
    We show that our model generates high quality images, with a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 16.65. We additionally assess the quality of the images with cancer tissue characteristics (e.g. count of cancer, lymphocytes, or stromal cells), using quantitative information to calculate the FID and showing consistent performance of 9.86. Additionally, the latent space of our model shows an interpretable structure and allows semantic vector operations that translate into tissue feature transformations. Furthermore, ratings from two expert pathologists found no significant difference between our generated tissue images from real ones.

    ![tran](./images/publications/dnnlibgen/DNNLibGen.png){: width="35%" height="35%" style="float:left; padding:16px"} **Abstract:** We propose a new modeling methodology using deep learning techniques for generating timing 
    models for Static Timing Analysis (STA). Current device behavior is non-linear, non-monotonic and exhibits high sensitivity to (Process Voltage Temperature) PVT variation which imposes a 
    myriad of design challenges including the need for analysis at several PVT corners. While complete PVT coverage is crucial for detecting design issues early and achieving time-to-market goals 
    with improved predictability, the number of PVT corners are growing exponentially and library generation has also become a significant bottleneck in current design cycles. To this end, we have 
    developed a novel methodology for timing library generation that uses data from sparse characterization in PVT space and generates delay models at required sign-off corners. 
    We have employed deep neural nets with residual connections for delay modeling and our methodology enables a 'single model' to fully comprehend multiple cell types, PVT corners 
    and generate required PVT timing libraries. The proposed library-generator uses a novel inter-corner model to generate delay tables at 17 test corners using 7 corners as reference. 
    In addition, we have developed an intra-corner model, to generate dense 8x8 delay tables using delays from 10 slew/load points as reference. The results show that, using these models, 
    we are able to achieve key improvements with over 98.7% of calculated delays within acceptable tolerance while reducing characterization run-time for early milestones by up to 60%.
