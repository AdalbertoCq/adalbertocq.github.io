about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I'm a second year PhD student advised by [Ke Yuan](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=PIQ_ZhUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Roderick Murray-Smith](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=laX7LzQAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Univeristy of Glasgow, Computing Science department. 

  I'm interested in generative models, causal inference, representation learning and interpretability of latent variable models. Additionally, my current research focuses on applying generative models to histopathology and how these models can help to better understand cancer tissue.

  On a personal level, I'm interested in U.S., U.K. and E.U. politics, politcal/social science and their intersection with machine learning.
  
  Before starting the PhD, I worked in the semiconductor industry as a SoC Design engineer in the [FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) field at Altera Coporation and Intel Corporation in San Jose, CA. I received an M.S. in Electrical Engineering at the IIT in Chicago, and M.S. and B.S. degrees in Telecommunications Engineering at ETSIT-UPM in Madrid.
