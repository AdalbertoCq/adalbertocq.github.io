      <p>I’m a second year PhD student advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=PIQ_ZhUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Ke Yuan</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=laX7LzQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Roderick Murray-Smith</a> at the Univeristy of Glasgow, Computing Science department.</p>

<p>I’m interested in generative models, Bayesian nonparametrics, representation learning and interpretability of latent variable models. Additionally, my current research focuses on applying generative models to histopathology and how these can help to better understand cancer tissue.</p>

<p>Before starting the PhD, I worked in the semiconductor industry as a SoC Design engineer in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a> field at Altera Coporation and Intel Corporation in San Jose, CA. I received a MSc in Electrical Engineering at the IIT in Chicago, and MSc and BSc in Telecommunications Engineering at ETSIT-UPM in Madrid.</p>

Current machine learning research for digital pathology focuses on diagnosis, 
but we suggest a different approach and advocate that generative models could help to understand and find fundamental morphological characteristics of cancer tissue. 
In this paper, we develop a framework which allows GANs to capture key tissue features, and present a vision of how these could link cancer tissue and DNA in the future. 
To this end, we trained our model on breast cancer tissue from a medium size cohort of 526 patients, producing high fidelity images. We further study how a range of relevant 
GAN evaluation metrics perform on this task, and propose to evaluate synthetic images with clinically/pathologically meaningful features. Our results show that these models are 
able to capture key morphological characteristics that link with phenotype, such as survival time and Estrogen-receptor (ER) status. Using an Inception-V1 network as feature extraction, 
our models achieve a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 18.4. We find that using pathology meaningful features on these metrics show consistent performance, with a FID of 8.21. 
Furthermore, we asked two expert50athologists to distinguish our generated images from real ones, finding no significant difference between them.</p>

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-print-12 details"><h4>'DNNLibGen : Deep Neural Network Based Fast Library Generator' Eunice Naswali, Adalberto Claudio Quiros, Pravin Chandran. 2019.</h4></div>
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-print-12"><p class="quote">26th IEEE International Conference on Electronics Circuits and Systems
</p><p><img src="./images/DNNLibGen.png" alt="tran" width="35%" height="35%" style="float:left; padding:16px" /> We propose a new modeling methodology using deep learning techniques for generating timing 
models for Static Timing Analysis (STA). Current device behavior is non-linear, non-monotonic and exhibits high sensitivity to (Process Voltage Temperature) PVT variation which imposes a 
myriad of design challenges including the need for analysis at several PVT corners. While complete PVT coverage is crucial for detecting design issues early and achieving time-to-market goals 
with improved predictability, the number of PVT corners are growing exponentially and library generation has also become a significant bottleneck in current design cycles. To this end, we have 
developed a novel methodology for timing library generation that uses data from sparse characterization in PVT space and generates delay models at required sign-off corners. 
We have employed deep neural nets with residual connections for delay modeling and our methodology enables a ‘single model’ to fully comprehend multiple cell types, PVT corners 
and generate required PVT timing libraries. The proposed library-generator uses a novel inter-corner model to generate delay tables at 17 test corners using 7 corners as reference. 
In addition, we have developed an intra-corner model, to generate dense 8x8 delay tables using delays from 10 slew/load points as reference. The results show that, using these models, 
we are able to achieve key improvements with over 98.7% of calculated delays within acceptable tolerance while reducing characterization run-time for early milestones by up to 60%.</p>
